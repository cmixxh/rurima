This project does not follow OCI standard and can only be a `PARTIAL` replacement of docker, this project is still under development.       
For Android users, You might need to root your phone before using rurima, some container might not work properly with proot.         
# Features:
- Get rootfs images from dockerhub or LXC mirror.
- Automatic parse docker image config and convert to ruri cmdline.
- Unpack rootfs images with or without root privileges.
- Backup/Restore rootfs with tar.
- Built-in container runtime by ruri.
- Static binary for multiple architectures.
- Built-in OTA(upgrade) feature.

In a word, rurima is a lightweight container implementation, it tries to get the most features of docker with the least dependencies, even when your kernel does not support cgroups or namespaces.

# Also, keep up to date:
Some updates and news will be posted on:      
[Twitter(X)](https://x.com/RuriOSS)      
And, don't forget to `rurima ota` to get the latest build!      
# What's new:
- We have a unified `pull` command to get images from dockerhub or LXC mirror now.       
- Some other OCI compatible registry like ghcr.io could work with `-f/--fallback` option enabled now.      
# Backward compatibility:
We promise that rurima has backward compatibility of documented parts since v0.9.x, all unstable parts will be explicitly marked as WIP or unstable, and ruri has already been backward compatible. Users can always keep `rurima ota` to get the latest build.           
For any issue, please notify us, and we will fix it ASAP.                 
# About:
So, what is rurima?       
The enhanced version of ruri.          
[ruri](https://github.com/Moe-hacker/ruri) only focus on running container, but rurima can also provide the function of getting rootfs image and backup/restore.          
And it will be a more powerful container manager in the fulture.            
With the `docker` and `lxc` subcommand of rurima, you can search & get & unpack images from dockerhub or LXC mirror easily.       
# Download:
You can get rurima binary (staticly linked) for arm64, armv7, armhf, riscv64, i386, loong64, s390x, ppc64le and x86_64 from the release page.     
Or run the follwing command to get rurima to ./rurima and ./rurima-dbg(debug version):     
```sh
. <(curl -sL https://get.ruri.zip/rurima)
```   
# Install dependencies:
For termux, run:
```
pkg install wget curl jq coreutils file proot tar xz-utils gzip
```
For Debian/Ubuntu based system, run:
```
apt install wget curl jq coreutils file proot tar xz-utils gzip
```
For RedHat/CentOS/Fedora based system, run:
```
dnf install wget curl jq coreutils file proot tar xz gzip
```
For Alpine based system, run:
```
apk add wget curl jq coreutils file proot tar xz gzip
```
# About suid or caps:
Rurima does not allow to set any suid/sgid (with root) or capability on it, it will check it in main() and error() if detected these unsafe settings.      
So, please always use sudo instead.     
# Reporting bugs:
Please use the debug version(rurima-dbg) in release to get debug logs, and please tell me the command you run to cause the unexpected behavior you think!                     
# Dependent:   
rurima needs tar, xz, gzip, file, you can find these static binary for aarch64, armv7, x86_64, i386 or riscv64 in：      
[tar-static](https://github.com/Moe-sushi/tar-static)      
[xz-static](https://github.com/Moe-sushi/xz-static)     
[gzip-static](https://github.com/Moe-sushi/gzip-static)     
[file-static](https://github.com/Moe-sushi/file-static)      
rurima need `curl` for downloading images, you can find a third party build here (Thanks stunnel) [stunnel/static-curl](https://github.com/stunnel/static-curl).      
rurima need `sha256sum` for checking downloaded file from dockerhub, use `--fallback` option can disable this.      
rurima need `jq` for parsing json, you can find it in [jq](https://github.com/jqlang).      
rurima also need proot if you are unpacking rootfs without root privileges, you can find it by the following way:      
First, you know your cpu arch, then, for example for aarch64:      
```sh
curl -sL https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/alpine/edge/testing/aarch64/ | grep proot-static
```
You got:      
```
<tr><td class="link"><a href="proot-static-5.4.0-r1.apk" title="proot-static-5.4.0-r1.apk">proot-static-5.4.0-r1.apk</a></td><td class="size">118.8 KiB</td><td class="date">25 Oct 2024 19:10:30 +0000</td></tr>
```
So that you download:      
```
https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/alpine/edge/testing/aarch64/proot-static-5.4.0-r1.apk
```
and finally, tar -xvf *.apk to unpack it. So you got proot.static, rename it to proot and put it in your $PATH.
